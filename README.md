# Introduction

This is a very simple and modest 2D RPG created with Godot Engine, designed to be a Zelda-like game, but that could add more elements.

All the concepts here have as main goal to be flexible and allow others to design they own games.

> *Important*: This project uses the Godot Engine 3.1, that [you can download here](https://hugo.pro/projects/godot-builds/).
