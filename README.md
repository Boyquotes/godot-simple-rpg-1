## Contributing

### Join us at Discord

We have a channel at the [Discord](https://discord.gg/25yBgEZ) where you can chat with us. I don't care, you can speak Eglish or Portuguese, but I'll prefer that at least in the project channel you speak only English. Thank you!

### Guidelines

This is an open source project, so all contributors are welcome. For better productivity and communication, we have some community principles that you should be aware of.

1. New features should be discussed first. So, feel free to create an issue, tag is as a *feature request* and *discussion*, so everyone could join the conversation and find if it is really desired.
2. We are following the code guideline propoused by GDQuest, that you can [check here](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).
3. The project mantainers could refactor your code to make it compatible with the project idea and also to follow the project code style.
4. Every asset used by the project (it includes graphics, sounds, fonts, etc) should be [licenced by Creative Commons (CC0)](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)
