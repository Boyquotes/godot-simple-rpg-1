2. We are following the code guideline propoused by GDQuest, that you can [check here](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).
3. The project mantainers could refactor your code to make it compatible with the project idea and also to follow the project code style.
